# mithril-example

This is an example mithril app, that I have setup with a sweet config

This config let's you write JSX in mithril components, because JSX is decoupled from react (sweetness)

Anyway there are three commands

## start
```
npm start
```

## start:dev
```
npm run start:dev
```

## build
```
npm run build
```

I highly reccomend using the Deno fileserver to host your built application (it's cool)
